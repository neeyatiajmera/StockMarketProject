With that knowledge I decided to look for blue chip companies that have had steady holdings over the past year. I referred to this website: https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-blue-chip-stocks-to-buy-this-year?slide=2\n",

    "3) JP Morgan Chase\n",
    "4) Johnson and Johnson\n",
